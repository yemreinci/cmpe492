# Parallel WebAssembly Applications on Browsers

Welcome to my final year project!

This project evaluates how useful parallel CPU programming techniques are when they are used in WebAssembly. We apply techniques like loop unrolling, multithreading, vector instructions, register reuse optimizations on various algorithms, and compare their performance effects.

**Note**: This study is still a work-in-progress.

## Folder Structure

* `mm/` contains dense matrix multiplication implementations.
* `conv/` contains 2-dimensional convolution implementations.
* `util/` contains utility headers for testing and benchmarking.
* `reports/` contains benchmark results.
* `misc/` is for miscellaneous stuff.

## Prerequisities

*Required software and tools on how to compile and run the project will be explained here*.

## Reproduction

*The instructions for reproducing the results will be explained here*


More will be added on benchmark results and derived conclusions in the future...
