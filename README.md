# Parallel WebAssembly Applications

Welcome to my final year project!

This project evaluates how useful parallel CPU programming techniques are when they are used in WebAssembly. We apply techniques like loop unrolling, multithreading, vector instructions, register reuse optimizations on two algorithms, and compare their performance effects.

## Folder Structure

* `mm/` contains dense matrix multiplication implementations.
* `conv/` contains 2-dimensional convolution implementations.
* `util/` contains utility headers for testing and benchmarking.
* `misc/` is for miscellaneous stuff.
